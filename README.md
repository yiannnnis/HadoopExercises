4th year project. The objective of this project was to apply clustering logic, via Hadoop, to a set of customer purchasing data obtained from a super market. After the data has been clustered a set of Map-Reduce Hadoop Functions are applied to recieve specific information from the cluster.


The data can be found in the personality_analysis.csv file in the main directory and the Map-Reduce Functions in each of the corresponding directories.
